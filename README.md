# 🧑‍💻 Quality Assurance Test
## 📝 Project Overview

Your first task will be to focus on testing our Prepayment Charge Calculator page, which is located at https://rfa.ca/PrepaymentChargeCalculator. This tool allows users to calculate the prepayment charge on their mortgage.

## 🔧 Tools and Methodologies

As a QA Engineer, you will be working extensively with two key tools: Cypress and Behavior-Driven Development (BDD).

Cypress is a powerful testing framework that enables us to write end-to-end tests that run in the browser. It provides a simple and intuitive API for writing tests, and its built-in assertions and debugging tools make it easy to identify and fix issues.

BDD is a software development methodology that emphasizes collaboration between different teams to ensure that everyone has a shared understanding of the product and its features. It involves writing tests in a natural language format that can be easily understood by all stakeholders, including developers, product managers, and QA engineers.

## 💻 Test Tasks

To complete our test, we would like you to complete the following tasks using Cypress and BDD:

1. Write a BDD feature file that describes a user entering a prepayment type, current term, term maturity date, current interest rate, current mortgage balance, regular payment amount, payment frequency and seeing the prepayment charge calculated.
2. Write step definitions for each step in the feature file, using Cypress to implement the actual test steps.
3. Run the BDD test using Cypress and ensure that it passes.
4. Use BDD to write additional feature files for other scenarios, such as a user entering invalid inputs or seeing the prepayment charge change based on different input values.
